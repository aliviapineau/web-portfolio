                <p align="center"><em>See why the highest levels of government and business – from the Pentagon to the world&rsquo;s top investing houses – rely on Joel&rsquo;s insights.</em>                </p>
                <p>Joel Litman is NOT Wall Street&rsquo;s biggest fan. </p>
                <p>For years, he worked as a CPA for big firms like Deloitte, Credit Suisse, and PricewaterhouseCoopers. </p>
                <p>And what he saw bothered him. </p>
                <p>Joel started keeping track of the inconsistencies he was finding in companies&rsquo; books. Eventually, he tallied up 130 common miscalculations due to GAAP accounting, the method everybody uses on Wall Street – which hasn&rsquo;t effectively updated its accounting standards since 1936. </p>
                <p>&ldquo;Accounting is hard to understand, even for CPAs,&rdquo; Joel says. &ldquo;When I started on Wall Street, I realized nobody knew anything about how distorted the financials were.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>The inconsistencies were so bad, Joel found they completely misrepresented a company&rsquo;s performance. In short, companies were being forced to report false earnings whether they liked it or not. </p>
                <p>Even worse, GAAP accounting allowed bad actors to intentionally misrepresent themselves and get away with fraud.  </p>
                <p>And all that bad accounting filtered down to investors and the media. Joel knew that every day, people were making lifechanging decisions with their money based on inaccurate, sometimes fraudulent information. </p>
                <p>Joel got so fed up, he quit Wall Street and got to work developing a better business valuation system … one that relied on accurate accounting practices and showed investors the REAL value of a company and whether they should invest.</p>
                <p>You can find a lite version of his system on this website called the Wall Street Truth Detector. Joel&rsquo;s clients have paid up to $100,000 a month to use his system, but until May 10, <strong><a href="truth-detector.html">you can use this basic version for free.</a></strong></p>
                <p>Try it out with hundreds of stocks on Wall Street … and see which stocks could double or triple in value over the coming months (and which could tank).</p>
                <p>The method behind this system has helped Joel find and expose 57 companies since 2008.  50 of them crashed to nearly zero or went bankrupt within months of Joel&rsquo;s analysis.</p>
                <p>Joel&rsquo;s also warned the public about:</p>
                  <ul class="shortList no-padding">
                  <li class="bullets"><p>The crash of 2008…</p></li>
                  <li class="bullets"><p>The COVID crash of 2020…</p></li>
                  <li class="bullets"><p>…and <em>dozens</em> of stocks that&rsquo;ve crashed since 2020 alone – with <em>average</em> losses of 54%.</p></li>
                </ul>
				
                <p>But Joel isn&rsquo;t just about helping people protect their money. He&rsquo;s also given investors a heads-up about <em>positive</em> discrepancies in the earnings of companies across Wall Street… </p>
                  <ul class="shortList no-padding">
                  <li class="bullets"><p>Like Advanced Micro Devices, which Wall Street was pricing in 2015 as if it was going bankrupt. But Joel&rsquo;s deep accounting work said it was time to buy and the stock skyrocketed 4,200%...</p>
                  		</li>
					  <li class="bullets">
						  <p>Facebook, before it shot up 1,300%...</p>
                  		</li>
					  <li class="bullets">
					  <p>And a tiny tech stock you&rsquo;ve probably never heard of called eXp World Holdings, which went on to soar 800% in less than a year.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>In fact, Joel&rsquo;s delivered numerous triple-digit winners for his clients and followers, including 148% on UNFI… 350% on EXPI… 1,364% on MIDD… and more.</p>
                <p>How does he do it? Well, Joel&rsquo;s system is like daily x-ray vision into 32,000 public companies… offering investors the chance to spot a stock&rsquo;s moves months, or even <em>years</em>, in advance.</p>
                <p>Joel&rsquo;s breakthroughs have touched the upper ranks of banking, business, and academia around the world. Billionaires, global investment houses, and over half the world&rsquo;s top money managers have read his work. </p>
                <p>He&rsquo;s also advised the highest levels of government including the FBI and the Pentagon, where he recently briefed officials on China&rsquo;s threat to American security (proven via forensic accounting, of course).</p>
                <p><img src="img/joel-collage.png" class="imgCenter"></p>
                <p>And until May 10, you can access Joel&rsquo;s system for free on this website and use it to see how hundreds of stocks on Wall Street measure up.</p>

                <p>Joel says one of these stocks could be one of the biggest winners of 2023 – while the other could crash up to 80% before the year is out.</p>
